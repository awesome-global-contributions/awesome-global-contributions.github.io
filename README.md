# awesome-global-contributions.github.io

This branch is just the deployment branch.
To visit the source code go to
[the 'source' branch](https://github.com/awesome-global-contributions/awesome-global-contributions.github.io/tree/source).

This is necessary, because github pages only work
from the master branch for organisations.
